# OpenMovieApp
This is an android app which I made from scratch as a part of Android Developer Nanodegree program.
This app reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.

## Features

With the app, you can:
* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
* Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews


## How to Work with the Source

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app.
